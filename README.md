# Brick_Breacker_TFT

**Brick Breaker TFT** is a version of the classic *Brick Breaker* game implemented for TFT screens using  **Arduino (Mega)** . The objective of the game is to destroy all the blocks (bricks) on the screen using a ball controlled by the player, which moves left and right. The ball bounces off the platform, and each time it hits a brick, the brick disappears. The game ends when the player loses all lives.
